# JetpackComposePlayground
Jetpack Compose Playground is my path to learn and practice every thing about the Jetpack Compose library, and specially what Google is recommending.
This is the new UI part of Android and it's a chance to start learning it from the first stable version 1.0.
It seems like it's a long journey but it's worth it. 


 ###### This big repos should contains a lot of project if you wanna read code
 ###### I use a Kanban project, [link](https://github.com/BraveDroid/JetpackComposePlayground/projects/), for an Agile Learning ;).
